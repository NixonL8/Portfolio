# Design Guidelines for Nixon L's Developer Portfolio

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach** drawing inspiration from modern developer portfolios like Linear (clean typography, subtle animations), GitHub (technical credibility), and Vercel (minimalist sophistication). This portfolio balances professional credibility with visual impact to showcase Nixon's technical journey and potential.

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette

**Dark Mode Primary** (default):
- Background Base: 222 15% 8%
- Background Elevated: 222 15% 12%

- Text Primary: 0 0% 98%
- Text Secondary: 0 0% 70%
- Border Subtle: 222 15% 20%

**Strategic Color Usage:**
- Primary accent for interactive elements, project card borders, skill badges
- Secondary accent sparingly for achievement highlights and section dividers
- High contrast for readability of code/technical content

### B. Typography

**Font Stack:**
- Headlines: 'Space Grotesk' (Google Fonts) - Modern, geometric, tech-forward
- Body: 'Inter' (Google Fonts) - Readable, professional
- Code/Technical: 'JetBrains Mono' (Google Fonts) - For skill tags and technical elements

**Type Scale:**

- Small Text/Labels: text-sm

### C. Layout System

**Spacing Primitives:** Use Tailwind units of 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32
- Section padding: py-20 md:py-32 for major sections
- Card padding: p-6 md:p-8
- Element spacing: gap-6 md:gap-8 for grids
- Container: max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6 md:px-8

**Grid Strategy:**
- Projects: 3-column masonry-style grid (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3)
- Skills: 4-column grid for categories (grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4)
- Experience/Education: Single column timeline with side decorations

### D. Component Library

**Navigation:**
- Fixed header with glass-morphism effect (backdrop-blur-lg bg-background/80)
- Smooth scroll navigation with active section indicators
- Mobile: Slide-in menu with animated hamburger icon

**Hero Section:**
- Full viewport height (min-h-screen) with gradient overlay
- Animated greeting text with typewriter effect on name
- Floating geometric shapes (subtle, non-distracting) using CSS transforms
- CTA buttons: Primary (filled) + Secondary (outline with blur background)
- Scroll indicator at bottom

**Project Cards:**
- Hover-lift effect (hover:translate-y-[-4px] transition-transform)
- Border glow on hover using primary accent
- Tech stack tags with pill design (rounded-full with subtle background)
- GitHub link icon in top-right corner
- Image thumbnail or gradient placeholder at top
- Description with truncation (3 lines max)

**Experience/Education Timeline:**
- Vertical line connector on left (hidden on mobile)
- Date badges with pill background
- Content cards with elevated background
- Stagger animation on scroll

**Skills Grid:**
- Category-based organization (Languages, Frameworks, Tools, Soft Skills)
- Icon + label badges with hover scale effect
- Progress indicator bars for proficiency levels

**Contact Form:**
- Two-column layout (form + contact info) on desktop, stacked on mobile
- Floating label inputs with focus states
- Success/error states with micro-animations
- Social links with icon hover animations

### E. Animations

**Use Sparingly - Quality Over Quantity:**
- Hero: Subtle fade-in-up on load (duration-700)
- Sections: Intersection Observer triggered fade-in as user scrolls
- Cards: Hover effects only (lift + glow)
- Form: Input focus ring animations
- No distracting parallax or scroll-jacking effects

## Section-Specific Guidelines

**Hero:**
- Background: Gradient from 222 15% 8% to 195 95% 15% with noise texture overlay
- Split layout: Left (60%) - Text content, Right (40%) - Animated code snippet or abstract visualization
- Floating social links (LinkedIn, GitHub) with glass-morphism style

**About:**
- Personal photo (circular, bordered with primary accent) floated left on desktop
- Quote-style typography for the passion statement
- Supporting stats (CGPA, Projects Count, Experience Duration) in pill badges

**Projects (Showcase):**
- Featured project (first) - larger card spanning 2 columns
- Remaining projects in masonry grid
- Filter/tabs for project categories (Web, Cloud, Security, ML)
- Modal on click showing detailed project breakdown with screenshots

**Experience:**
- Timeline format with company logos (if available, else initial badges)
- Expandable cards showing key achievements as bullet points
- Tech tags for technologies used

**Skills:**
- Four-category grid with visual hierarchy
- Icon library: Devicons or Simple Icons for tech logos
- Soft skills with custom icons or emoji

## Images

**Large Hero Image:** NO - Using gradient background with code visualization instead

**Supporting Images:**
- Profile photo in About section (circular, 200x200px minimum)
- Project thumbnails (16:9 ratio, 800x450px minimum) for each project card
- Achievement icons/badges (SVG preferred, 64x64px)
- Optional: Company logos for experience section (120x40px)

**Image Treatment:**
- Rounded corners (rounded-xl for cards, rounded-full for profile)
- Subtle shadow and border (border border-subtle)
- Lazy loading for performance

## Responsive Breakpoints

- Mobile: < 768px - Single column, stacked navigation, full-width cards
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px - 2-column grids, adjusted spacing
- Desktop: > 1024px - Full multi-column layouts, expanded spacing

## Accessibility

- Dark mode optimized (default) with maintained contrast ratios (WCAG AA)
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Focus indicators using primary accent with increased contrast
- Semantic HTML structure (section, article, nav)
- Alt text for all images
- Form labels properly associated with inputs
